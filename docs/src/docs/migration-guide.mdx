# Migration from 1.x

If you're still using Unform in any version below 2.0.0, we highly recommend you following this guide.

## Package name

Since unform supports React Native now, we changed all the packages name:

- `@unform/core`: Core funcionalities, needed in web and mobile;
- `@unform/web`: Web integration, used in ReactJS;
- `@unform/mobile`: Mobile integration, used in React Native;

<br />

Use the platform (web/mobile) package to import `Form` component, all the other funcionalities can be imported directly from `@unform/core`.

## Input components

Since Unform 2.0, the package **do not include it's own inputs anymore**, so you cannot import Input, Select ou any other input components from unform library.

Now you need to create your own inputs following the Recipes and Third party examples here in docs.

Check the [Simple input](/recipes/simple-input) guide to create your first input.
